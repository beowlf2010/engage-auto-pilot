# Troubleshooting & Maintenance SOP

## Purpose
This SOP provides systematic approaches to identify, diagnose, and resolve common issues with the AI messaging system and CRM platform.

## System Architecture Overview

### Core Components
1. **AI Messaging Engine** - Automated message generation and sending
2. **Lead Management System** - Customer data and interaction tracking
3. **Compliance Engine** - Regulatory compliance and opt-out processing
4. **Analytics Platform** - Performance monitoring and reporting
5. **Integration Layer** - Third-party service connections

### Data Flow
```
Lead Entry → AI Assessment → Message Generation → Compliance Check → 
Message Delivery → Response Processing → Lead Update → Analytics
```
